#1. Numeric Operations: 
#a. Create two integer variables, num1 and num2, and assign them values. 
#b. Calculate and print the sum, difference, product, and quotient of num1 and num2.

num1 = 2
num2 = 5

sum = num1 + num2
difference = num2 - num1
product = num1 * num2
quotient = num1 / num2
print("The sum is " + str(sum) + " The difference is " + str(difference) + " The product is "
      + str(product) + " The quotient is " + str(quotient))
